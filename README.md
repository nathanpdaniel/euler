# project euler
I've started working through the Euler Problems in my spare time

If you want to check it out, you can download this repo.
To run/test the JavaScript version, I built with node/npm.  The only dependencies are for testing ([Mocha](https://mochajs.org)) and [Chai](https://chaijs.com)).

Open terminal and cd to the `euler/javascript` directory

`npm install` to install testing libraries

`npm start` to run the index file (not really necessary, and there's no telling what the index file will be running at any given time :D)

To run unit tests:
`npm test`
