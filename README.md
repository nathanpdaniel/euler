# project euler
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
I've started working through the Euler Problems in my spare time

To run/test the JavaScript version, I built with node/npm.  The only dependencies are for testing ([Mocha](https://mochajs.org)) and [Chai](https://chaijs.com)).

Open terminal and cd to the `euler/javascript` directory

`npm install` to install testing libraries

To run tests:
`npm test`
